## 📌 HIGHLIGHT PROJECT

### COLLEGE TIME TABLE AND NOTICE BOARD DISPLAY WITH AUTO SMS TO FACULTY

This Paper Aims to present a Technology-Based Notice Board using "COLLEGE TIME TABLE AND NOTICE BOARD WITH AUTO SMS TO FACULTY". We are using the GSM Module for Sending and Receiving the Message. Once the period is set, GSM Module sends message to that particular Faculty, when class begins; It additionally changes the Information in notice board through straight forward SMS. This project consist of LCD Module, GSM Module and RTC Module, which all are interfaced Arduino (ATMEGA328P). It also consist of BUZZER which also interfaced Arduino (ATMEGA328P) for indication of period completion like college bell. The wireless network is designed with idea of a SMS, as the SMS send by the GSM Module based on the period setting by using RTC and Switches; For changing the information in the notification board, any user can send SMS to Mobile Number which is present on the GSM Module.- Built a technology-driven notice board system that integrates college timetable and notice board display.
